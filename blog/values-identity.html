      <h2>What Myer Briggs Has to Say</h2>
      <p>A Campaigner (ENFP) is someone with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. These people tend to embrace big ideas and actions that reflect their sense of hope and goodwill toward others. Their vibrant energy can flow in many directions.</p>
      <p>The Campaigner personality is a true free spirit. They are often the life of the party, but unlike types in the Explorer Role group, Campaigners are less interested in the sheer excitement and pleasure of the moment than they are in enjoying the social and emotional connections they make with others. Charming, independent, energetic and compassionate, the 7% of the population that they comprise can certainly be felt in any crowd.</p>
      <h3>Strengths</h3>

            <li>Excellent Communicators</li>
            <li>Know How to Relax</li>
            <li>Popular and Friendly</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Poor Practical Skills</li>
            <li>Find it Difficult to Focus</li>
            <li>Overthink Things</li>
            <li>Get Stressed Easily</li>
            <li>Highly Emotional</li>
            <li>Independent to a Fault</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Althought there are a few things in there that I don't agree with, a lot of them - mainly the weaknesses - I think are quite accurate.</p>
      <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>
      <p>Being of NZ European decent, I feel I don’t have a true ‘culture’ that I identify with or one that has shaped me during my life. 
      However, living in New Zealand has exposed me to a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, through which I’ve grown up loving the diversity that this brings. 
      Because of this, I’ve also thought it’s important to be respectful towards others, regardless of their background, and to always be compassionate towards people who are less fortunate than myself.</p>
      <h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h2>
      <p>When it comes to things I’m interested in, I’m naturally curious and observant, which will help me to pick up skills necessary to learn programming.</p> 
      <p>With programming being a collaborative space that requires you to work alongside people, I feel the communication skills I’ve learned over the past five years working in marketing will help me. Combined with my friendly and easy-going nature, I think I have the potential do well in this area.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I find it difficult to focus and get distracted easily. This was a problem for me when I was at school and continues to be a problem today. When tasks become repetitive, monotonous, and or simply boring I lose focus. However, when I find that I’m being challenged and being creative I can stay on task.</p>
      <p>I can often overthink things when it comes to making a decision and being confident with what I’m doing. This overthinking leads me to slowing down my decision making or not being totally confident in what I’m doing. Working on my decision making and knowing that no one is perfect and that making mistakes are normal will hopefully help this.</p>
      <h2>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h2>
      <p>Because I’m naturally curious and observant with something when I’m interested in it, I feel like I’ll be able to pick up the necessary skills to succeed. This curiosity will make me go outside of the supplied material to supplement my own learning and look for additional content to help support what I have already learnt  Although at times I can get frustrated when I can’t solve a problem, with a solid learning program, I’ll know what to do when I hit these roadblocks.</p>
      <p>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
      Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</p>
