       <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
       <p>
         Ideally, I want to get to a position where I’m a confident web developer which allows me 
         greater flexibility in my work choices. I want to be able to choose to either work for 
         myself or for a company, work remotely or in an office.
       </p>
       <p>
         I also know that I want to go travelling again one day and having a skill like web development 
         would be perfect to compliment that.
       </p>
       <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2> 
       <p>
         I would like to improve my decision making, my confidence in my work, and continue to grow my 
         communication skills to help reduce any friction that can occur when working in teams.
       </p>
       <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h2>
       <p>
         Currently my plan is to work between 9 - 5pm, and although this doesn’t always go to plan, this is the 
         rough schedule I have given myself. When things are starting to build up and I’m struggling, I’m going 
         to first acknowledge the problem and that it’s okay to be in this situation. I’ll remove myself from 
         the situation and take a break to calm down. Have some lunch, go for a walk, listen to some music, chat 
         to a friend who works in a similar job, whatever. I’ll then try to tackle the problem from a different 
         angle and see if I can break the problem down to smaller tasks that I can complete.
       </p>
       <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
       <p>
         If I’m struggling with anything during the course, and can't solve the problem in a resonable amount of 
         time, I’ll reach out to my cohort to see if anyone there can help. If not, I’ll seek out the help from 
         my facilitator.
       </p>
       <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
       <p>
         I expect the facilitation team to provide helpful and insightful guidance, without any judgement. I expect 
         them to reply in a reasonable timeframe and to also be on time for any catch ups we have scheduled in.
       </p>
       <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h2>
       <p>
         On Monday nights I play indoor netball, and the time ranges between 6 - 9.30pm. Apart from that, nothing else.

        <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>
          I’m not sure I have a longterm goal as of yet, but I want to be able to become a confident web developer that 
          has the ability to create websites that combine awesome design and usability.
        </p>
        <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
        <p>
          I think because I’m a good communicator	, I’ll be able to work in pairs or as a team no worries. I’m also an 
          empathetic person so I’ll be able to understand and acknowledge others struggles, point of view, ideas and be 
          able to take them on board, help out, or provide any support necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest limitations I think may be struggle to stay focus for nine weeks straight and keeping on top of all 
          the material given to us.
        </p>
        <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
        <p>
          I think working alongside people who are more technically capable than me will be challenging. It potentially will 
          make me feel bad about myself and my own skill level at times, making me feel like I’m not as capable. I need to 
          continue to learn this is okay and draw from as much knowledge around me as possible, and understand being in these 
          situations are normal and there’s nothing wrong with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will need to continue to work and learn with a growth mindset so that I don't feel threatened by the success of 
          others, and rather, use it to find lessons and inspiration that can improve myself.
        </p>
        <h2>What non-technical skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
        <p>
          I would like to continue to improve my confidence in myself and my work. I think I can be too hard on myself, 
          constantly being a critic and getting bogged down in negative thoughts.
        </p>
        <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
        <p>
          From the bootcamp team I expect helpful and constructive feedback, I expect them to try and explain things in a way 
          that I will understand as I may not know certain jargon or specific methods they’re talking about.  
        </p>
        <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout foundations, I would spend too long on a problem and not seek help, slowing down my learning and also 
          wasting time. In future, at bootcamp, I will seek help as soon as I’m stuck. If it’s something I cannot solve, I 
          will see if someone else in my cohort can help, assuming they have the time - I will need to be mindful of 
          everyone’s time. If not, I will seek help from a facilitator. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also going to give this course 110% and try and learn as much as I can, while giving it my best. I have a rough
          long term goal and I want to achieve that. This course will get me there and so I need to try and be completely 
          focused on it. I understand that I will struggle and be put under stress, but with my learning plan, I hope to be 
          able to navigate this as best I can.
