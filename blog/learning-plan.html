       <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
       <p>Ideally, I want to get to a position where I’m a confident web developer which allows me greater flexibility in my work choices. I want to be able to choose to either work for myself or for a company, work remotely or in an office.</p>
       <p>I also know that I want to go travelling again one day and having a skill like web development would be perfect to compliment that.</p>
       <br>
       <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2> 
       <p>I would like to improve my decision making, my confidence in my work, and continue to grow my communication skills to help reduce any friction that can occur when working in teams. </p>
       <br>
       <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h2>
       <p>Currently my plan is to work between 9 - 5pm, and although this doesn’t always go to plan, this is the rough schedule I have given myself. When things are starting to build up and I’m struggling, I’m going to first acknowledge the problem and that it’s okay to be in this situation. I’ll remove myself from the situation and take a break to calm down. Have some lunch, go for a walk, listen to some music, chat to a friend who works in a similar job, whatever. I’ll then try to tackle the problem from a different angle and see if I can break the problem down to smaller tasks that I can complete.</p>
       <br>
       <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
       <p>If I’m struggling with anything during the course, and can't solve the problem in a resonable amount of time, I’ll reach out to my cohort to see if anyone there can help. If not, I’ll seek out the help from my facilitator.</p>
       <br>
       <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
       <p>I expect the facilitation team to provide helpful and insightful guidance, without any judgement. I expect them to reply in a reasonable timeframe and to also be on time for any catch ups we have scheduled in.</p>
       <br>
       <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h2>
       <p>On Monday nights I play indoor netball, and the time ranges between 6 - 9.30pm. Apart from that, nothing else.</p>
