        <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>I won’t know everything, and that’s okay</strong> - Coming into foundations, I had an expectation that I was going 
                to have to learn everything about the three languages in order to do well. Core has taught me that this isn’t 
                necessary and that I only need to learn so much if I learn how to problem solve effectively.
            </li>
            <li><strong>This is something I can do</strong> - I always thought programming was or the insanely smart, people who excelled 
                in maths and science. Core has taught me that with the right mindset and mentality, this is something that I can achieve. 
                I just need to stay focused and keep learning.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stop comparing myself to others</strong> - Throughout foundations, I’ve constantly compared myself to others and this 
                has quite often led me to feel bad about my own learning journey and progress as I feel like I’m lagging behind and not quite 
                good enough. I’ve slowly taught myself that this is okay, to find happiness in the success of others and use this as motivation 
                to continue to learn and better my own understanding. 
            </li>
          </ol>
        <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>  
          <p>
            They help define who someone is and what they truly believe in. When you understand your values, you can understand what you want 
            out of something and what you expect from those around you. This allows you to make clearer and smarter decisions.
          </p>
        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>  
          <p>
            How the brain functions and how we learn. I think I’m a slow learner and I use to label this as failing, which is why I struggled 
            at school, and hence probably a big factor why I never went to university. I was scared to attempt ‘study’ as I was afraid I would 
            be a failure. Learning about things like neuroplasticity and a growth mindset has taught me that I can learn new skills and that 
            struggling isn’t necessarily a bad thing, you’re just not there ‘yet’.
          </p>
        <h2>* What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
          <p>
            Evaluating myself. I don’t usually stop to think about myself and how I operate and learn best. It was challenging to write that 
            down and think “yeah, this is me, this is how I work, think” etc.
          </p>  
        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
          <p>
            I think learning Core skills from the start is good as it teaches people valuable skills that will help them not only in their 
            career, but also bootcamp. Bootcamp and the real world can be extremely challenging and stressful so knowing how you work and 
            learn best and how to navigate this I’m important.
          </p>  
        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?</h2>  
          <p>
            I don’t believe it was a waste of time, no. I think it teaches important skills necessary to succeed in the tech industry. However, 
            I feel like for some people, like myself, who feel like they haven’t quite grasped JavaScript and feel like they aren’t quite prepared 
            for the start of Bootcamp, it would be good to feel a little more confident in myself and with my knowledge of JavaScript going into 
            bootcamp. I feel like Core could have been reduced slightly and more could have been put into teaching tech. That said, I really enjoyed 
            this Core section as I believe it has taught me some valuable skills that will serve me greatly.
