            <h1>Neuroplasticity. What Is It?</h1>
            <p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of the neural networks in the brain to change through growth and reorganisation due to one’s environment by forming new neural connections over time. When learning something new, i.e coding, the brain responds by forming new neural pathways, and the more time one spends practicing that new skills, the stronger that pathway becomes. The opposite is also true, the less time one spends accessing that neural pathway, the weaker it becomes.</p>
            <p>Understanding neuroplasticity is important as it can encourage people to learn and improve new skills that they thought they might not have been able to obtain previously because the believed they weren’t smart enough or had the capability. Because the mind is malleable This leads into the idea of having a growth mindset rather than a fixed mindset, which I will discuss shortly.</p>
            <p>Learning about neuroplacticty is good for me as it gives me encouragement to know that learning to code is something that is very accomplishable. Even though at times it’s difficult to understand and comprehend, I need to keep practicing and strengthen my neural pathways that I’ve created.</p>
            <p>Along with continuing to practice coding and revise the material that I’ve already learnt, there are other exercises I can do to help stimulate further nueroplasticity. Others that I might look to incorporate into my schedule are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Yoga: Practicing yoga has been associated with decreased stress levels in the amygdala, the fear center of the brain.</li>
                <li>Reading: New concepts and new vocabulary increase and enhance brain connectivity.</li>
                <li>Sleeping: While not traditionally considered an “exercise,” sleep helps with learning and memory retention by transferring information across cells and growing connections between neurons.</li>
                <li>Non-dominant hand exercises: Using your non-dominant hand for everyday activities like brushing your teeth or using a mouse forces the brain to form new neural connections.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h1>Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset</h1>
            <p>Coined by Carol Dweck, a growth and fixed mindset are used to describe the underlying beliefs people have about learning and intelligence. When people believe they can get smarter, they understand that effort makes them stronger. Therefore, they put in the time and effort, which ultimately, can lead to higher achievement.</p>
            <p>A fixed mindset is the idea that knowledge and intelligence are fixed, and what you’re born with is what you have. People with this mindset are always comparing themselves with over-achievers, feeling that they need to prove themselves through their own success. Let’s take a look at the two mindsets now:</p>
            <h2>Fixed Mindset - The idea that intelligence is static:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Tends to avoid challenges</li>
                <li>Gives up easily</li>
                <li>Sees effort as fruitless or worse</li>
                <li>Ignores useful negative feedback</li>
                <li>Feels threatened by the success of others</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a result, people can plateau early and achieve less than their full potential.</p>
            <h2>Growth Mindset - The idea that intelligence can be achieved:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Embraces challenges</li>
                <li>Persists in the face of obstacles</li>
                <li>Sees effort as the path to mastery</li>
                <li>Learn from criticism</li>
                <li>Find lessons and inspiration in the success of others</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a result, people can reach ever-higher levels of achievement.</p>
            <p>With my learning, I have fallen victim to being too hard on myself when I don’t understand material or I compare myself to the success of others, making me feel like I can’t achieve something. In the past, I’ve too often had a fixed mindset, and learning about this has helped me to identify the problems that I experience.</p>
            <p>Learning isn’t linear. It’s a road that takes many twist and turns, bumps and blocks. But you won’t get to your destination by giving up when you first get lost or come across a bump in the road. Through adopting a growth mindset, I can start to rewire the way I think and understand that through having a greater desire to learn and being persistent, I can achieve my goals and reach my destination.</p>
