          <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence</h2>
          <p>In simple terms, Emotional Quotient, or Emotional Intelligence, is ability to identify and manage your emotions and the emotions of others. An individual who shows a high level of EQ is able to work with a wide variety of people and a variety of situations as they have the ability to sense, understand and effectively apply good decision making when navigating emotions to help facilitate higher levels of productivity and collaboration.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
          <p>Where EQ focuses on the recognition and understanding of different emotions, IQ, or Intelligence Quotient, is simply the measure of someone’s relative intelligence. IQ focuses solely on the individual and their intelligence. EQ focuses on one’s understanding of emotions and how that can help with better understanding other’s emotions and how to better navigate social situations.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>Why is it Important</h2>
          <p>Understanding of your own emotions will greatly help someone to deal with situations when a certain emotion is prevalent i.e anxiety, anger, fear. If you understand your emotions, you can help to control them and think before you act on them. A high understanding of EQ is beneficial for a working environment as you are socially aware of the emotions of others and how or what you say might say might effect them.</p>
          <p>Through this emotional understanding, people with a strong EQ can make great team players and/or leaders as they posses the ability to understand, empathise, and connect with the people around them.</p>
