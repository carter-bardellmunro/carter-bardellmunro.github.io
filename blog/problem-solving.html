        <h1>My Experience With Problem Solving So Far..</h1>
        <p>
          During my time doing the Kata challanges, I found that I struggled with most of them. Because I feel like I still haven't quite grasped 
          JavaScript, most of them were challenging. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I would take my time, read through the questions and notes in Student Handbook snd Repl to see if I could understand what was being asked of me. 
          I understood what was being asked, but not how I would complete the task. I would try pseudocoding, trying something, the rubber ducky method, and 
          Googling it. More often than not, this wouldn't quite help me, as to understand what you're searching for, you need to know what it is you want to do. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After being stuck on any given challenge for some time, I would look at the answers that were provided in Repl. Now, instead of just copying and 
          pasting, I would read through the answer to try and understand it, then return to the index page to try and write the code myself. Once I had done 
          this and passed the test, I would then Google each part of the code to try and gain a better understanding of it and why each part was being used. I 
          would then use the rubber ducky method and explain out loud the challenge and why it had been written that way to try and help solidify what I 
          had just done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I didn't feel great about not being able to solve the challenge and having to look at the answers, I definitely felt like I was failing. But I also 
          realised that I can't expect myself to know how to do everything and understand each and every challenge to the fullest just yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was I solving anything in an elegant manner? Well, no. I wouldn't say I was. Unfortunately I haven't really had many 'AHA' moments of sudden realisition
          where I've solved a problem and it's all just clicked. However, through this method, I've been able to work backwards in a sense, and break down code 
          step-by-step and help provide me with more information. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I know this isn't the best method of learning for now, but as I continue to supplement my learning elsewhere, i.e doing extra online courses and watching 
          tutorials, I will improve my skills and the need for this method will reduce.
        </p>
        <h1>How Confident Am I Using the Following Methods:</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>Pseudocode - So far, I've used this method very little. I know it's helpful to fully understand the challenge and I'll continue to do it more as I go along.</li>
            <li>Tring something - I always tried something. However, usually didn't work. I was either a mile off or relatively close but needed a little more guidance.</li>
            <li>Rubber ducky method - I used this method often when I was stuck and I wanted to interpret code and explain to myself why things were being used. I found it 
              helpful and will continue to use it going forward.
            </li>
            <li>Reading error messages - I tried to do this and could sometimes decipher what it was saying but I was usually left just as confused. As I continue to learn
              and understand more, I'll be able to make more sense of error messages.
            </li>
            <li>Console.logging - Something I didn't use at all.</li>
            <li>Googling - Used this method all the time. Only downside is that in order to find the right code, you need to understand what it is you're lookig for.</li>
            <li>Asking peers for help - I've done this a few times, with good results, but it's sometimes not the bets method. It can be hard explaining your problem, 
              people are busy themselves and can't always reply, and there can be a delay in getting a response. Once we're a bootcamp, this will be an extremely helpful 
              methid for me.
            </li>
            <li>Asking coaches for help - Tried this a few times but haven't found it super helpful, more or less for the same reasons as above. Again, once I'm at bootcamp, 
              this will be an extremely helpful method for me.
            </li>
            <li>Improving your process with reflection - This is probably something I didn't do enough of. At times, I felt like I had been stuck on a problem for so long, 
              that when I finished it, I felt like I was behind and needed to move on to the next challenge. Going forward, I'm going to take more time to reflect on what 
              I've learnt.
